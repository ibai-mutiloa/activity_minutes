## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a vulnerability, please report it **privately** so we can address it before public disclosure.

### **How to Report:**
1. **Email**: [security@yourdomain.com](mailto:security@yourdomain.com) *(or replace with GitHub‚Äôs private vulnerability reporting)*
2. **GitHub Private Reporting**: [Click here](https://github.com/Muti9289/activity_minutes/security/advisories)
3. **Response Time**: We will acknowledge your report within **48 hours**.
4. **Disclosure Policy**: If confirmed, we will work on a fix and release it within **7-14 days**.

**Please do NOT report security vulnerabilities via GitHub issues.** This ensures that potential exploits are not publicly disclosed before they are fixed.
